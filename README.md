### About
This project was our first introduction to more complex JavaScript and using HTML Canvas. We were tasked with re-creating a game of our choice. We chose to create a clone of the game [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird), but designed to mimic the general appearence of a Turing classroom during lunch break! (Burritos and Mountain Dew).
